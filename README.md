# Code duplication detecter

## How to run the tests
First, make sure you have added the package to the Python path of your machine.

```
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/your/package:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Now, from root folder execute the test
```
python3 tests/test_duplication.py
```

In future development, pytest will be used to execute the tests












export PYTHONPATH="/home/angelg/Documents/school/compilers/code_duplication:$PYTHONPATH"
